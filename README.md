# M2A2-R-Scripts
Repository of Scripts and Work in R
February 23, 2020

I want to put a copy of the main scripts I've been working on in R in a public place  - primarily so I can learn how
GitHub works.

After years in marketing, I have become more interested in data analytics, data science, machine learning, 
and predictive analytics.

I am in the midst of rebranding myself as an analytics expert rather than a marketing expert.
It is a slow process.  But I believe this is the kind of work I should be doing.
